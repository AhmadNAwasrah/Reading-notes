   # HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER 
   * HTML CONTENT LAYER
   * CSS PRESENTATION LAYER
   * JAVA SECRIPT BEHAVIOR LAYER
   # CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT 
   *  Create a folder to put the
example in called cOl, then start
up your favorite code editor, and
enter the text to the right.
A JavaScript file is just a
text file (like HTML and CSS
files are) but it has a . j s file
extension, so save this file with
the name add-content . j s

*  Get the CSS and images for
this example from the website
that accompanies the book:
www.javascriptbook. com
To keep the files organized, in
the same way that CSS files
often live in a folder called
styles or css, your JavaScript
files can live in a folder called
scripts,javascript,orjs.
In this case, save your file in a
folder called j s 

# LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT
# FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE
## When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML
<script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. 
# <script src="js/ add-content.js"></ script>


# JAVA SECRIPT RUNS WHRER IT FOUNDED IN HTML


# GENERAL ADVICES TO BE GOOD PROGRAMER 

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 

* The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created. 





# BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS

* STATEMENTS 

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

# JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE
JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means
something different to HourNow or HOURNOW. 
* STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND
EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE 

* STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED
INTO CODE BLOCKS 
 
 # COMMENTS 
 You should write comments to explain what your code does.  
 I* Th i s script displays a greeting to the user based upon the current time.
It is an example from JavaScript & jQuer y book *I 

# WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
  A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.  

When you write JavaScript, you have to tell the
interpreter every individual step that you want it to
perform. This sometimes involves more detail than
you might expect.  

# how to declare variables :
 var varname ; 

 # how to assigen them variables : 
 varname=5;

 # DATA TYPES

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans. 
# NUMERIC DATA TYPE
The numeric data type handles
numbers.
0.75 
# STRING DATA TYPE
The strings data type consists of
letters and other characters.
'H.
1 ' Ivy! 1

# BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
Boolean data types can have one
of two values: true or false.
true  

# USING A VARIABLE TO
STORE A NUMBER  
var price;
var quantity;
var total;
price = 5;
quantity = 14;

# USING A VARIABLE TO
STORE A STRING  
var username;
var message;
username = 'Molly'; 

# USING A VARIABLE TO
STORE A BOOLEAN  
var i nStock;
var shipping;
inStock = true;
shipping= false;

# CHANGING THE VALUE
OF A VARIABLE 

var inStock;
var shipping;
inStock = true;
shipping = false; 
inStock = false;
shipping = true; 

# RULES FOR NAMING
VARIABLES
* 1
The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number. 

* 2
The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name 

* 3  You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.
ONLINE EXTRA
View a full list of keywords and
reserved words in JavaScript. 

* 4
All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.

* 5
Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.

* 6
If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).
