# Is it hard to Learn?
No, it is not hard to learn HTML. In fact, once you take the plunge and go for it, you'll quickly discover that beyond a few simple concepts, there's nothing hard about HTML at all. Within a few short hours you'll have the basics down and be well on your way!
# what we need to larn ?

**HTML**
 is used to
create web pages. You will see
that you start by writing down
the words you want to appear
on your page. You then add tags
or elements to the words so
that the browser knows what is
a heading, where a paragraph
begins and ends, and so on.


**CSS**

uses rules to enable you to
control the styling and layout
of web pages. We then go on to
look at the wide variety of CSS
properties you can use in your
CSS rules. These properties
generally fall into one of two
categories:
Presentation: How to control
things like the color of text, the
fonts you want to use and the
size of those fonts, how to add
background colors to pages (or
parts of a page), and how to add
background images.
Layout: How to control where
the different elements are
positioned on the screen. You
will also learn several techniques
that professionals use to make
their pages more attractive.

# How People Access the Web
1 - Browsers 
People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.
2- Web Servers
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website
3- Screen readers 
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.

# How Websites Are Created

the first thing you need even before creating a website with HTML and CSS is a web server (hosting). Don’t worry, though; you don’t have to buy your own machine. Many web hosting companies will sell you a simple hosting service on their machines

# How the Web Works 

When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server


# Structure

How Pages Usev Structure
  
# Structuring Word Documents 

The use of headings and
subheadings in any document
often reflects a hierarchy of
information. For example, a
document might start with
a large heading, followed by
an introduction or the most
important information.
This might be expanded upon
under subheadings lower down
on the page. When using a word
processor to create a document,
we separate out the text to give
it structure. Each topic might
have a new paragraph, and each
section can have a heading to
describe what it covers.
On the right, you can see a
simple document in Microsoft
Word. The different styles for
the document, such as different
levels of heading, are shown
in the drop down box. If you
regularly use Word, you might
have also used the formatting
toolbar or palette to do this



# HTML Describes the Structure of Pages

In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly
the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want
to appear on the page.
You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what
the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next
page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen
is in black.

# HTML Uses Elementsto Describe the Structure of Pages

Let's look closer at the code from the last page.
There are several different elements. Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

# Attributes Tell Us More About Elements

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.

# Code in a Content Management System

If you are working with a content
management system, blogging
platform, or e-commerce
application, you will probably
log into a special administration
section of the website to control
it. The tools provided in the
administration sections of these
sites usually allow you to edit
parts of the page rather than
the entire page, which means
you will rarely see the <html>,
<head>, or <body> elements.
Looking at the content
management system on the
opposite page, you have a box
that allows you to enter a title
for the page, another box for the
main article, a way to enter a
publication date, and something
to indicate which section of the
site this page belongs in.
For an e-commerce store, you
might have boxes that allow you
to enter a title for the product,
a description of the product, its
price, and the quantity available.
That is because they use a single
'template' to control all of the
pages for a section of the site.
(For example, an e-commerce
system might use the same
template to show all of their
products.) The information
you supply is placed into the
templates.
The advantage of this approach
is that people who do not know
how to write web pages can
add information to a website
and it is also possible to change
the presentation of something
in the template, and it will
automatically update every page
that uses that template. If you
imagine an e-commerce store
with 1,000 items for sale, just

 # Looking at How Other sites are Built

 When the web was first taking
off, one of the most common
ways to learn about HTML and
discover new tips and techniques
was to look at the source code
that made up web pages.
These days there are many
more books and online tutorials
that teach HTML, but you can
still look at the code that a web
server sends to you. To try this
out for yourself, simply go to the
sample code for this chapter, at
www.htmlandcssbook.com/
code/ and click on the link called
"View Source."
Once you have opened this
page, you can look for the View
menu in your browser, and select
the option that says Source or
View source. (The title changes
depending on what browser you
are using.)
You should see a new window
appear, and it will contain the
source code that was used to
create this page.
You can see this result in the
photograph on the right. The
page you see is the window at
the top; the code is below.
At first this code might look
complicated but don't be
discouraged. By the time you
have finished the next chapter
of this book, you will be able to
understand it.
All of the examples for this book
are on the website, and you can
use this simple technique on any
of the example pages to see how
they work.

# Extra Markup

# The Evolution of HTML
Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML

Each new version was designed
to be an improvement on the
last (with new elements and
attributes added and older code
removed).
There have also been several
versions of each browser used to
view web pages, each of which
implements new code. Not all
web users, however, have the
latest browsers installed on
their computers, which means
that not everyone will be able to
view all of the latest features and
markup.
Where you should be
particularly aware of browsers
not supporting certain features,
I have made a note of this (as
you have seen with some of the
HTML5 elements introduced in
the Forms chapter — and as you
will see in the CSS chapters).
With the exception of a few
elements added in HTML5
(which have been highlighted),
the elements you have seen in
this book were all available in
HTML 4.
Although HTML 4 had some
presentational elements to
control the appearance of pages,
authors are not recommended to
use them any more. (Examples
include the <center> element
for centering content on a
page, <font> for controlling
the appearance of text, and
<strike> to put a line through
the text — all of these can be
achieved with CSS instead.)
In 1998, a language called XML
was published. Its purpose
was to allow people to write
new markup languages. Since
HTML was the most widely used
markup language around, it was
decided that HTML 4 should be
reformulated to follow the rules
of XML and it was renamed
XHTML. This meant that
authors had to follow some new,
more strict rules about writing
markup. For example:
● Every element needed a
closing tag (except for empty
elements such as <img />).
● Attribute names had to be in
lowercase.
● All attributes required a value,
and all values were to be
placed in double quotes.
● Deprecated elements should
no longer be used.
● Every element that was
opened inside another
element should be closed
inside that same element.

# DOCTYPEs 

Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).
We will therefore be including
one in each example for the rest
of the book.
As you will see when we come to
look at CSS and its box model on
page 316, the use of a DOCTYPE
can also help the browser to
render a page correctly.
Because XHTML was written
in XML, you will sometimes
see pages that use the XHTML
strict DOCTYPE start with
the optional XML declaration.
Where this is used, it should be
the first thing in a document.
There must be nothing before it,
not even a space . 

# Comments in HTML

f you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:
<!-- comment goes here -->
It is a good idea to add
comments to your code because,
no matter how familiar you
are with the page at the time
of writing it, when you come
back to it later (or if someone
else needs to look at the code),
comments will make it much
easier to understand.
Although comments are not
visible to users in the main
browser window, they can be
viewed by anyone who looks at
the source code behind the page.
On a long page you will often
see comments used to indicate
where sections of the page start
or end, and to pass on notes to
help anyone who is looking at
the code understand it.
Comments can also be used
around blocks of code to stop
that code from being displayed
in the browser. In the example on
the left, the email link has been
commented out.

# ID Attribute

Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
As you will see when you
come to look at CSS in the next
section, giving an element a
unique identity allows you to
style it differently than any other
instance of the same element
on the page. For example,
you might want to assign one
paragraph within the page
(perhaps a paragraph containing
a pull quote) a different style
than all of the other paragraphs.
In the example on the right, the
paragraph with the id attribute
whose value is pullquote is
made uppercase using CSS.
If you go on to learn about
JavaScript (a language that
allows you to add interactivity to
your pages), id attributes can be
used to allow the script to work
with that particular element.
The id attribute is known as a
global attribute because it can
be used on any element.

# Class Attribute
 Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
For example, you might have
some paragraphs of text that
contain information that is more
important than others and want
to distinguish these elements, or
you might want to differentiate
between links that point to other
pages on your own site and links
that point to external sites.
To do this you can use the
class attribute. Its value
should describe the class it
belongs to. In the example on
the left, key paragraphs have a
class attribute whose value is
important.
The class attribute on any
element can share the same
value. So, in this example, the
value of important could be
used on headings and links, too.

# Block Elements 

Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.  

# Inline Elements 
Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.

# Grouping Text & Elements In a Block 

The <div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
For example, you might create
a <div> element to contain all
of the elements for the header
of your site (the logo and the
navigation), or you might create
a <div> element to contain
comments from visitors.
In a browser, the contents of
the <div> element will start on
a new line, but other than this
it will make no difference to the
presentation of the page.
Using an id or class attribute
on the <div> element, however,
means that you can create
CSS style rules to indicate how
much space the <div> element
should occupy on the screen and
change the appearance of all the
elements contained within it.

# Grouping Text & Elements Inline 

The <span> element acts like
an inline equivalent of the <div>
element. It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text
where there is no other suitable
element to differentiate it from
its surrounding text
2. Contain a number of inline
elements
The most common reason why
people use <span> elements
is so that they can control the
appearance of the content of
these elements using CSS.

# IFrames 
An iframe is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page — and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.
One common use of iframes
(that you may have seen on
various websites) is to embed
a Google Map into a page. The
content of the iframe can be any
html page (either located on the
same server or anywhere else on
the web).
An iframe is created using the
<iframe> element. There are a
few attributes that you will need
to know to use it:
src
The src attribute specifies the
URL of the page to show in the
frame.
height
The height attribute specifies
the height of the iframe in pixels.
width
The width attribute specifies
the width of the iframe in pixels. 

scrolling
The scrolling attribute will
not be supported in HTML5. In
HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates
whether the iframe should
have scrollbars or not. This is
important if the page inside the
iframe is larger than the space
you have allowed for it (using the
height and width attributes).
Scrollbars allow the user to move
around the frame to see more
content. It can take one of three
values: yes (to show scrollbars),
no (to hide scrollbars) and auto
(to show them only if needed).
frameborder
The frameborder attribute will
not be supported in HTML5. In
HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates
whether the frame should have
a border or not. A value of 0
indicates that no border should
be shown. A value of 1 indicates
that a border should be shown.
seamless
In HTML5, a new attribute
called seamless can be applied
to an iframe where scrollbars
are not desired. The seamless
attribute (like some other new
HTML5 attributes) does not
need a value, but you will often
see authors give it a value of
seamless. Older browsers
do not support the seamless
attribute.

# Information About Your Pages

<meta>
The <meta> element lives
inside the <head> element and
contains information about that
web page.
It is not visible to users but
fulfills a number of purposes
such as telling search engines
about your page, who created
it, and whether or not it is time
sensitive. (If the page is time
sensitive, it can be set to expire.)
The <meta> element is an empty
element so it does not have a
closing tag. It uses attributes to
carry the information.
The most common attributes
are the name and content
attributes, which tend to be
used together. These attributes
specify properties of the entire
page. The value of the name
attribute is the property you
are setting, and the value of the
content attribute is the value
that you want to give to this
property.
In the first line of the example on
the opposite page, you can see a
<meta> element where the name
attribute indicates an intention
to specify a description for the
page. The content attribute is
where this description is actually
specified.
The value of the name attribute
can be anything you want it to
be. Some defined values for this
attribute that are commonly
used are:
description
This contains a description
of the page. This description
is commonly used by search
engines to understand what the
page is about and should be a
maximum of 155 characters.
Sometimes it is also displayed in
search engine results.
keywords
This contains a list of commaseparated words that a user
might search on to find the page.
In practice, this no longer has
any noticeable effect on how
search engines index your site.
robots
This indicates whether search
engines should add this page
to their search results or not. A
value of noindex can be used if
this page should not be added. A
value of nofollow can be used
if search engines should add this
page in their results but not any
pages that it links to



# Escape Characters
There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the
left and right angled brackets.) 
Therefore, if you want these
characters to appear on your
page you need to use what are
termed "escape" characters
(also known as escape codes or
entity references). For example,
to write a left angled bracket,
you can use either &lt; or
&#60;. For an ampersand, you
can use either &amp; or &#38;.
There are also special codes
that can be used to show
symbols such as copyright and
trademark, currency symbols,
mathematical characters, and
some punctuation marks. For
example, if you want to include a
copyright symbol on a web page
you can use either &copy; or
&#169;.
When using escape characters,
it is important to check the
page in your browser to ensure
that the correct symbol shows
up. This is because some fonts
do not support all of these
characters and you might
therefore need to specify
a different font for these
characters in your CSS code.

# HTML5 Layout
HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.
They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These
new elements are going to play an important part in creating
layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:
● The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
● How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
● How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still
subject to change but it is already widely being used by web
developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.

# Traditional HTML Layouts
 For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

On the right you can see a
layout that is quite common
(particularly on blog sites).
At the top of the page is the
header, containing a logo and the
primary navigation.
Under this are one or more
articles or posts. Sometimes
these are summaries that link to
individual posts.
There is a side bar on the righthand side (perhaps featuring
a search option, links to other
recent articles, other sections of
the site, or even ads).
When coding a site like this,
developers would usually put
these main sections of the page
inside <div> elements and use
the class or id attributes to
indicate the purpose of that part
of the page.


# New Html5 Layout Elements

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already

# Headers & Footers 

The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
● A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page.
In this example, the <header>
element used to contain the site
name and the main navigation.
The <footer> element contains
copyright information, along
with links to the privacy policy
and terms and conditions.
Each individual <article> and
<section> element can also
have its own <header> and
<footer> elements to hold the
header or footer information for
that section within the page.
For example, on a page with
several blog posts, each
individual post can be thought
of as a separate section. The
<header> element can therefore
be used to contain the title and
date of each individual post, and
the <footer> might contain
links to share the article on
social networking sites.

# Navigation 

The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.
Going back to our blog example,
if you wanted to finish an article
with links to related blog posts,
these would not be counted as
major navigational blocks and
therefore should not sit inside a
<nav> element.
At the time of writing, some of
the developers that were already
using HTML5 decided to use the
<nav> element for the links that
appear at the bottom of every
page (links to things like privacy
policy, terms and conditions
and accessibility information).
Whether this will be widely
adopted is still yet to be seen. 


# Articles 
The <article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.
This could be an individual
article or blog entry, a comment
or forum post, or any other
independent piece of content.
If a page contains several articles
(or even summaries of several
articles), then each individual
article would live inside its own
<article> element.
The <article> elements can
even be nested inside each
other. For example, a blog post
might live inside one <article>
element and each comment on
the article could live inside its
own child <article> element.
 
 # ASIDES

 The <aside> element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an <article>
element or not.
When the <aside> element
is used inside an <article>
element, it should contain
information that is related to the
article but not essential to its
overall meaning. For example, a
pullquote or glossary might be
considered as an aside to the
article it relates to.
When the <aside> element is
used outside of an <article>
element, it acts as a container
for content that is related to
the entire page. For example,
it might contain links to other
sections of the site, a list of
recent posts, a search box, or
recent tweets by the author.

# Sections 

The <section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.
For example, on a homepage
there may be several <section>
elements to contain different
sections of the page, such as
latest news, top products, and
newsletter signup.
Because the <section> element
groups related items together,
it may contain several distinct
<article> elements that have a
common theme or purpose.
Alternatively, if you have a
page with a long article, the
<section> element can be
used to split the article up into
separate sections.
The <section> element should
not be used as a wrapper for
the entire page (unless the
page only contains one distinct
piece of content). If you want a
containing element for the entire
page, that job is still best left to
the <div> element. 


# Heading Groups
 
 The purpose of the <hgroup>
element is to group together a
set of one or more <h1> through
<h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.
For example, the <hgroup>
element could be used to contain
both a title inside an <h2>
element and a subtitle within an
<h3> element.
This element has had a mixed
reception. When it was first
proposed by the people
developing HTML5, there were
some complaints and it was
withdrawn from the HTML5
proposals. However, some
people changed their minds and
it has been added it back into the
language. Some developers do
not like the use of the <hgroup>
element, and prefer to place a
subtitle inside a <p> element
(using an attribute to indicate
that it is a subheading).
Some suggest that it is of little
use other than as a styling hook.
It has, however, been popular
with those developers who
believe that it is useful to group
together the primary heading
and the subheading (as both can
be integral parts of a heading) 


# Figures 
You already met the <figure>
element in Chapter 5 when we
looked at images. It can be used
to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article (not just images).
It is important to note that the
article should still make sense
if the content of the <figure>
element were moved (to another
part of the page, or even to a
different page altogether).
For this reason, it should only be
used when the content simply
references the element (and not
for something that is absolutely
integral to the flow of a page).
Examples of usage include:
● Images
● Videos
● Graphs
● Diagrams
● Code samples
● Text that supports the main
body of an article
The <figure> element should
also contain a <figcaption>
element which provides a text
decription for the content of
the <figure> element. In
this example, you can see a
<figure> has been added inside
the <article> element. 


# Sectioning Elements
 It may seem strange to follow
these new elements by revisiting
the <div> element again. (After
all, the new elements are often
going to be used in its place.)
However, the <div> element
will remain an important way to
group together related elements,
because you should not be using
these new elements that you
have just met for purposes other
than those explicitly stated.
Where there is no suitable
element to group a set of
elements, the <div> element will
still be used. In this example, it is
used as a wrapper for the entire
page.
Some people have asked why
there is no <content> element
to contain the main part of
a page. The reason is that
anything that lies outside of the
<header>, <footer> or <aside>
elements can be considered as
the main content. 


# Linking Around Block-Level Elements 

HTML5 allows web page authors
to place an <a> element around
a block level element that
contains child elements. This
allows you to turn an entire block
into a link.
This is not a new element in
HTML5, but it was not seen as a
correct usage of the <a> element
in earlier versions of HTML. 


# Helping Older Browsers Understand

Older browsers that do not
know the new HTML5 elements
will automatically treat them as
inline elements. Therefore, to
help older browsers, you should
include the line of CSS on the
left which states which new
elements should be rendered as
block-level elements.
Also, IE9 was the first version of
Internet Explorer to allow CSS
rules to be associated with these
new HTML5 layout elements.
In order to style these elements
using earlier versions of IE, you
need to use a simple JavaScript
known as the HTML5 shiv or
HTML5 shim.
You do not need to understand
JavaScript to use it. You can
just link to a copy that Google
hosts on its servers. It should
be placed inside a conditional
comment which checks if the
browser version is less than
(hence the lt) IE9.
Unfortunately, this workaround
does require that anyone using

# Process & Design 


Who is the Site For?
 

 Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is. 
It can be helpful to ask some
questions about the people you
would expect to be interested in
the subject of your site.
If you ask a client who a site is
for, it is not uncommon for them
to answer "the entire world."
Realistically, it is unlikely to be
relevant to everyone. If your site
sells light bulbs, even though
most people using a computer
probably use light bulbs, they
are not likely to order them from
someone in a different country.
Even if the site has a wide
appeal, you can still think about
the demographics of a sample of
the target audience. 

# Why People Visit YOUR Website

Your content and design should
be influenced by the goals of
your users.
To help determine why people
are coming to your website,
there are two basic categories of
questions you can ask:
1: The first attempts to discover
the underlying motivations for
why visitors come to the site.
2: The second examines the
specific goals of the visitors.
These are the triggers making
them come to the site now. 

# WireFrames 

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require 


# Getting your message across using design 

# Visual hierarchy 

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find
information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for. 

# grouping and Similarity

When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a
design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved. 

# Designing Navigation 

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
Good navigation tends to follow these principles...
