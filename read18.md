# Forms

It's group of different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site.
### The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.

# Submitting Forms: 
 ## Making Choices:

 - Submit buttons
 - Image buttons
 - File upload
 
 # How the forms works :
  A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server. 

![img](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iBpE5.png)


# Form Structure
 ## form 
 Form controls live inside a
<form> element. This element
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too.

## action 
Every <form> element requires
an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the
information in the form when it submited .

## method 
Forms can be sent using one of
two methods: get or post. 

# Text Input
 
 - Inputs 
 The <input> element is used
to create several different form
controls. The value of the type
attribute determines what kind
of input they will be creating. 

- type="text"
When the type attribute has a
value of text, it creates a singleline text input 
 
 - name
When users enter information
into a form, the server needs to
know which form control each
piece of data was entered into.
(For example, in a login form, the
server needs to know what has
been entered as the username
and what has been given as the
password.) Therefore, each form
control requires a name attribute.
The value of this attribute
identifies the form control and is
sent along with the information
they enter to the server.
- maxlength
You can use the maxlength
attribute to limit the number
of characters a user may enter
into the text field. Its value is the
number of characters they may
enter. For example, if you were
asking for a year, the maxlength
attribute could have a value of 4

## Password Input

- type="password"
When the type attribute has
a value of password it creates
a text box that acts just like a
single-line text input, except
the characters are blocked out.
They are hidden in this way so
that if someone is looking over
the user's shoulder, they cannot
see sensitive data such as
passwords.
- name
The name attribute indicates
the name of the password input,
which is sent to the server with
the password the user enters.
- size, maxlength
It can also carry the size and
maxlength attributes like the
the single-line text input. 

## Text Are 

textarea 
The textarea element
is used to create a mutli-line
text input. Unlike other input
elements this is not an empty
element. It should therefore have
an opening and a closing tag.
Any text that appears between
the opening textarea and
closing textarea tags will
appear in the text box when the
page loads.
If the user does not delete any
text between these tags, this
message will get sent to the
server along with whatever the
user has typed. (Some sites
use JavaScript to clear this
information when the user clicks
in the text area .

# Radio Button 

- input
type="radio"
Radio buttons allow users to pick
just one of a number of options.
- name
The name attribute is sent to
the server with the value of the
option the user selects. When
a question provides users with
options for answers in the form
of radio buttons, the value of
the name attribute should be the
same for all of the radio buttons
used to answer that question.
- value
The value attribute indicates
the value that is sent to the
server for the selected option.
The value of each of the buttons
in a group should be different
(so that the server knows which
option the user has selected).
- checked
The checked attribute can be
used to indicate which value (if
any) should be selected when
the page loads. The value of this
attribute is checked. Only one
radio button in a group should
use this attribute. 

## Checkbox 

 - input
type="checkbox"
Checkboxes allow users to select
(and unselect) one or more
options in answer to a question.
- name
The name attribute is sent to
the server with the value of the
option(s) the user selects. When
a question provides users with
options for answers in the form
of checkboxes, the value of the
name attribute should be the
same for all of the buttons that
answer that question.
- value
The value attribute indicates
the value sent to the server if this
checkbox is checked.
- checked
The checked attribute indicates
that this box should be checked
when the page loads. If used, its
value should be checked.

# Drop Down List Box
 
 - select
A drop down list box (also
known as a select box) allows
users to select one option from a
drop down list.
The select element is used
to create a drop down list box. It
contains two or more option
elements.
- name
The name attribute indicates the
name of the form control being
sent to the server, along with the
value the user selected.
- option
The option element is used
to specify the options that the
user can select from. The words
between the opening option
and closing option tags will
be shown to the user in the drop
down box.
- value
The option element uses the
value attribute to indicate the
value that is sent to the server
along with the name of the
control if this option is selected

- File Input Box 
- input
If you want to allow users to
upload a file (for example an
image, video, mp3, or a PDF),
you will need to use a file input
box.
- type="file"
This type of input creates a
box that looks like a text input
followed by a browse button.
When the user clicks on the
browse button, a window opens
up that allows them to select a
file from their computer to be
uploaded to the website.
When you are allowing users
to upload files, the method
attribute on the  form element
must have a value of post. 
## Submit Button 

- type="submit"
The submit button is used to
send a form to the server.
- name
It can use a name attribute but it
does not need to have one.
- value
The value attribute is used to
control the text that appears
on a button. It is a good idea to
specify the words you want to
appear on a button because the
default value of buttons on some
browsers is ‘Submit query’ and
this might not be appropriate for
all kinds of form.

## Image Button 

-  type="image"
If you want to use an image for
the submit button, you can give
the type attribute a value of
image. The src, width, height,
and alt attributes

# Button & hidden Controls 

- button
The button element was
introduced to allow users more
control over how their buttons
appear, and to allow other
elements to appear inside the
button.
This means that you can
combine text and images
between the opening button
tag and closing button tag.
- input
type="hidden"
This example also shows a
hidden form control. These form
controls are not shown on the
page (although you can see them
if you use the View Source option
in the browser). They allow web
page authors to add values to
forms that users cannot see.


## Labelling Form Controls

- label 
 The <label> element can be
used in two ways. It can:
1. Wrap around both the text
description and the form input
(as shown on the first line of the
example to your right).
2. Be kept separate from the
form control and use the for
attribute to indicate which form
control it is a label for (as shown
with the radio buttons). 

- for
The for attribute states which
form control the label belongs to.
Note how the radio buttons use
the id attribute. The value of the
id attribute uniquely identifies an
element from all other elements
on a page 

## Grouping Form Elements 

fieldset
You can group related form
controls together inside the
fieldset  element. This is
particularly helpful for longer
forms.
Most browsers will show the
fieldset with a line around
the edge to show how they are
related. The appearance of these
lines can be adjusted using CSS.
 legend
The  legend  element can
come directly after the opening
 fieldset tag and contains a
caption which helps identify the
purpose of that group of form
controls.


## Email & URL Input

- input
HTML5 has also introduced
inputs that allow visitors to
enter email addresses and URLs.
Browsers that do not support
these input types will just treat
them as text boxes.
- type="email"
If you ask a user for an email
address, you can use the email
input. Browsers that support
HTML5 validation will check
that the user has provided
information in the correct format
of an email address. Some smart
phones also optimize their
keyboard to display the keys you
are most likely to need when
entering an email address (such
as the @ symbol).
- type="url"
A URL input can be used when
you are asking a user for a web
page address. Browsers that
support HTML5 validation will
check that the user has provided
information in the format of
a URL. Some smart phones
also optimize their keyboard to
display the keys you are most
likely to need when entering a
URL.


## Search Input 

- input
If you want to create a single
line text box for search queries,
HTML5 provides a special type
of input for that purpose.
- type="search"
If you want to create a single
line text box for search queries,
HTML5 provides a special
search input.
To create the HTML5 search box
the input element should
have a type attribute whose
value is search. Older browsers
will simply treat it like a single
line text box.

- placeholder
On any text input, you can
also use an attribute called
placeholder whose value is
text that will be shown in the
text box until the user clicks in
that area. Older browsers simply
ignore this attribute.
# Lists, Tables and Forms 

## Bullet Point Styles
 
 ### list-style-type
 

 The list-style-type property
allows you to control the shape
or style of a bullet point (also
known as a marker).
It can be used on rules that
apply to the ol, ul, and li
elements.
Unordered Lists
For an unordered list you can use
the following values:
 - none
 disc
 - circle
 - square
### Ordered Lists
For an ordered (numbered) list
you can use the following values:
- decimal
1 2 3
- decimal-leading-zero
01 02 03
- lower-alpha
a b c
- upper-alpha
A B C
- lower-roman
i. ii. iii.
- upper-roman
I II III

## Images for Bullets
### list-style-image

You can specify an image to act
as a bullet point using the
list-style-image property.
The value starts with the letters
url and is followed by a pair
of parentheses. Inside the
parentheses, the path to the
image is given inside double
quotes.
This property can be used on
rules that apply to the ul and
 li elements.
The example on this page also
shows the use of the margin
property to increase the vertical
gap between each item in the
list.

# Positioning the Marker
 
 ## list-style-position
 Lists are indented into the page
by default and the list-styleposition property indicates
whether the marker should
appear on the inside or the
outside of the box containing the
main points.
This property can take one of
two values:
- outside
The marker sits to the left of the
block of text. (This is the default
behaviour if this property is not
used.)
- inside
The marker sits inside the box of
text (which is indented).
In the example shown, the width
of the list has been limited to 150
pixels. This ensures that the text
wraps onto a new line so you can
see how the value of inside sits
the bullet inside the first line of
text. 

## Table Properties 

You have already met several
properties that are commonly
used with tables. Here we will
put them together in a single
example using the following:
width to set the width of the
- table
padding to set the space
between the border of each table
cell and its content
text-transform to convert the
content of the table headers to
- uppercase
letter-spacing, font-size
to add additional styling to the
content of the table headers
border-top, border-bottom
to set borders above and below
the table headers
text-align to align the writing
to the left of some table cells and
to the right of the others
background-color to change
the background color of the
alternating table rows
:hover to highlight a tab .

# Gaps Between Cells
