# Choosing A Text Editor

 # What is a text editor?

 A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

# Using The Software That Already
Comes With Your Computer
Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”
And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text
editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of
your particular distribution. These text editors will go by different
names. One distro might have “Gedit,” and others might have other
titles. Check you list of applications to see which text editor comes
with your distribution of Linux.
Since these text editors already come on your computers, why should
you download yet another text editor that does essentially the same
thing as the text editor that you already have? There are other text
editors that have features that you may be interested in, like the ones
we discussed before. Usually, the text editors that come on your
computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest
bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.
While you certainly can use Notepad and Text Edit to make websites,
there are other text editors available that might help you code more
efficiently. I invite you to judge for yourself and form your own
opinions.

# Third-Party Options



Let’s talk about software like:
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each
of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked
about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are
widely used in web development today

Third-Party Options example : 
 - NotePad++ 
 NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only.

Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux
computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has
everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the
web developing community


- Atom

Atom is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows
computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. Atom is brought to
you by the folks at GitHub . GitHub is a great service online where
you can host and review code, or you can post and get help with the
development of your own projects. Atom also ticks all the right boxes.
It has syntax highlighting, themes, extensions, the works! Atom is
definitely a software to check out and test drive for yourself.

- Brackets

Brackets is a free text editor that’s available for download for
Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. It’s made
and maintained by the good folks at Adobe—yep, the Photoshop
people. Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though
more coding capabilities can be added through extensions. Being that
Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this might be a
great choice to start with. But still the choice is yours.

- Sublime Text

Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be purchased in full
for $70. Otherwise you’ll use the free version. Sublime Text enjoys a
history of being fast and responsive while being extensible as well.
There’s no doubt that Sublime Text will tick the check boxes of what
to look for in a text editor. It has syntax highlighting, it has code
completion, it has themes and extensions. And will definitely get the
job done no matter how advanced you get with your coding.





# The Difference Between Text
# Editors and IDEs

 used as IDEs. A text editor is just for writing/modifying text/code. With an IDE, you should do a lot more within that single program; running, debugging, version control
